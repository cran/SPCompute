Title: Compute Power or Sample Size for GWAS with Covariate Effect
Version: 1.0.3
Author: Ziang Zhang, Lei Sun
Maintainer: Ziang Zhang <aguero.zhang@mail.utoronto.ca>
Description: Fast computation of the required sample size or the
    achieved power, for GWAS studies with different types of covariate
    effects and different types of covariate-gene dependency structure.
    For the detailed description of the methodology, see Zhang (2022)
    "Power and Sample Size Computation for Genetic Association Studies
     of Binary Traits: Accounting for Covariate Effects" <arXiv:2203.15641>.
